Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist.
He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
